## Phase 2 — Designer MVP

> Phase 2 is the highest-risk phase per the external-review pass: a drag/drop visual editor is genuinely a small IDE. Phase 2 is split into **Required** (form-based view editor, 6 essentials, no canvas) and **Stretch** (visual canvas + drag/drop). The five tasks below cover the Required slice.

| Id | Title | Owner | Status | Last update | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CODEX-M | `apps/designer` — Tauri shell, project explorer, form-based view editor | codex | open (no remaining blockers — Phase 2 exit demo) | 2026-04-27 claude | [tasks/CODEX-M-designer-shell.md](tasks/CODEX-M-designer-shell.md) |

CODEX-M is the only open Phase 2 task. With `tag.write` now wired end-to-end (CODEX-N), the designer's NumericInput preview will exercise the full operator-write loop on first run.

## Phase 1 — Vertical slice (PLC tag in browser, simulator-backed)

**🎉 Phase 1 complete.** Released as [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/sergiogallegos/OpenWebHMI/releases/tag/v0.1.0). Exit criterion met: a PLC tag from the Rockwell driver, sourced from `examples/sim-rockwell`, updates live in the browser through the gateway, with quality propagation on simulator restart. Hardware validation remains gated to pre-1.0 (per `docs/roadmap.md`).

*(no open Phase 1 tasks)*

## Conventions

- **Status values:** `open`, `in-progress`, `submitted`, `under-review`, `merged`, `rejected`.
- **`merged` rows** move to the `## Done` section with their merge commit reference.
- **Owner ≠ author of brief.** Owner is who is currently *doing* the work. Briefs are always authored by claude.
- **One row per task file.** If a task spawns subtasks, give them their own ids.
